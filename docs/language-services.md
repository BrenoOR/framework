# Tests and linting
Both Lua and Typescript strategy scripts are linted and tested to perform some
basic validity and style checks. For Lua, linting is done by *luacheck*, for
Typescript by *tslint*. *python2* is required for some additional checks.

To run the unit tests and linter, execute the following in your build folder
```
make check
```

## Typescript
Typescript linting is done with a project local installation of *tslint*. IntelliSense is provided by *tsserver*.

To make use of those, you first need to install *npm* which is usually distributed
alongside [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). On most modern Linux Systems, it should
be possible to insall it with your distributions respective package manager. If
you choose to install it manually, it is necessary to add *Node*'s binary
folder to your `PATH`.

- Linux & MacOS: Run the `setup.sh` script located at `strategy/typescript`

Windows:
1. Open a Command Line and change directory to `strategy/typescript`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy the contents of `libs/tsc/built/local` to `strategy/typescript/node_modules/typescript/lib` and overwrite the existing files

### Editor integration

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code has a Typescript plugin installed by default. You'll need
You will also need [Microsoft's `tslint` plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin).
If you make sure to open the `strategy/typescript` folder (not the base
`software` folder) in VS Code, it should automatically use the project-local
`node_modules` folder. You can verify this, check [the Microsoft docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript)

#### Vim8/Neovim
There are multiple plugins providing language server integration for Vim but I use and recommend [`coc.nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim). For the setup:
1. Install [`coc.nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
2. Run `:CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-tslint-plugin coc-json`

## Luacheck
Install according to the following platform dependent instructions.
Alternatively, the source files are available at
https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck .

#### Linux
Install luarocks and use it to install luacheck

```

On Ubuntu 14.04 it may be necessary to use
```
luacheck -q **/*.lua
```

#### macOS
Install luarocks and use it to install luacheck
```
brew install lua
luarocks install luacheck
```

#### Windows
- Download the prebuilt luacheck package from
https://www.robotics-erlangen.de/downloads/libraries/luacheck-0.18.7z .
- Extract the contained luacheck folder and move it to `%APPDATA%` (enter path in Explorer). The luacheck.bat in the _bin_ folder should now be located at
`<USER>\AppData\Roaming\luacheck\bin\luacheck.bat`.
- Open the _Control Panel_ (Systemsteuerung), open _User Account_ (Benutzerkonten), then _Change own Environment Variables_.
Add to *User* variables:
`PATH` = `%APPDATA%\luacheck\bin`
